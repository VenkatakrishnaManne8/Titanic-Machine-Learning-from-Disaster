# Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-DisasterDescription:
This project's aim is to predict whether the passengers survive or not from Titanic
shipwreck using machine learning algorithms. It is a part of the Kaggle competition
where we can submit the code for prediction, and it will rank us based on accuracy.

How to use:
1. Create a Kaggle account and join the Titanic competition.
2. Click on the new notebook to write the code.
3. Install all the Python libraries.
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
import plotly.graph_objects as go
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
4. Write the code in notebook and run all in Kaggleâ€™s python IDE.
5. After executing save the output and submit in competition as .csv file
6. After submitting, I got accuracy of 0.78229
